## Notes

* Build folder structure and write dispatch.yaml
* Write app.yaml files for each module
* Write main.go for web to serve index.html page (protected) - will rely on app.yaml to serve rest of static files
* use `goapp serve` to see the website running (with login) - but with errors
* build out API foundations
  decode
  respond
  respondErr
  etc
* Add question first
